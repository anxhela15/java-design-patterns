# Singleton‐Example README

## Non‑Synchronized Singleton  
The non‑synchronized singleton uses simple lazy initialization without any locking, making it extremely lightweight in single‑threaded applications. It’s best employed when you can guarantee that the singleton’s `getInstance()` is invoked from a single thread (for example, during application startup) before any other threads are spawned. You should avoid this variant in multi‑threaded contexts, as simultaneous calls to `getInstance()` can result in multiple instances.  

## Synchronized Singleton  
The synchronized singleton synchronizes the entire `getInstance()` method, ensuring that only one thread may enter the initialization block at a time. This approach guarantees thread safety even if the singleton is first accessed by multiple threads concurrently. However, the method‑level lock incurs performance overhead on every call, which can become significant under heavy contention. It’s most appropriate when the simplicity of a fully synchronized accessor outweighs the cost of locking, such as in applications with moderate concurrency during startup or configuration phases.  

## Double‑Checked Locking Singleton  
Double‑checked locking reduces the synchronization penalty by checking the instance both before and after acquiring the lock. It relies on the `volatile` keyword to prevent instruction reordering and guarantee visibility of the initialized instance across threads. This pattern is ideal for high‑performance, multi‑threaded environments where `getInstance()` is invoked frequently after the singleton has been initialized. By limiting synchronization to the first creation of the instance, it balances thread safety with minimal ongoing overhead.  

## Common Use Cases  
Singletons are widely used for managing shared resources such as configuration managers, logging frameworks, database connection pools, and thread pools, where a single, globally accessible instance simplifies resource coordination and avoids unnecessary duplication.
