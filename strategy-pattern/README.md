# Strategy Pattern Demo

This is a simple Maven project demonstrating the Strategy Design Pattern in Java 17.

## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. It promotes composition over inheritance and makes it easy to add new behaviors without modifying existing code.
