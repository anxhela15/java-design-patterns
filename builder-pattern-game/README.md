# Builder Design Pattern in Java

## Overview
The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that facilitates the step-by-step construction of complex objects. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.  

## Intent
To separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.  

## Advantages
* **Improved Readability:** Makes the code more readable by clearly indicating what parameters are being set.

* **Immutability:** The final object can be made immutable, enhancing thread safety.

* **Flexibility:** Allows for optional parameters without the need for multiple constructors.

* **Separation of Concerns:** Separates the construction logic from the representation.
